# Project Proposal: Abqar Store Sales Documentation

## Project Overview

The Abqar Store Sales Documentation Project aims to create comprehensive academic documentation for a digital sales management system that transforms traditional paper-based retail operations into an efficient, data-driven digital platform. This project serves as a complete academic deliverable covering all aspects from initial planning to final implementation, following university standards for software engineering projects.

## Project Background and Problem Statement

### Current State
Traditional retail stores rely heavily on paper-based systems for sales tracking, customer management, and inventory control. This approach leads to:
